The course is part of the bachelor education in nature management, and the students are (mostly) taking the course in their third study semester. It is not intended to replace the text book we are using in the course (see Leganto for the reading list), but rather to supplement it. There is, however, one main part that is not well covered in the text book and for which this digital compendium will be the main source. This is chapter XX - Applied Popluation Ecology.",

    "text": "5.1 Harvesting wild vertebrate populations\nOne classical application of population ecology theory is related to harvesting of wild vertebrate populations, including those that live in the oceans (i.e. fisheries!). In this chapter, the focus will be on harvesting of terrestrial vertebrate - including both various species of game birds as welll as mammals of various size and taxa. In the chapter, I will show how the theory surrounding harvest management have matured over the years, and now consists of mature and well-developed body of literature. Importantly, much of the development has happened in parallel in terrestrial ecology and in the fisheries. Marine fisheries are often associated with substantial economic interests, and thus for at least some marine fisheries substantial resources have been allocated to produce better models (and data) to support the quota setting process. The same situation applies to some terrestrial harvest management systems (e.g. moose management in Scandinavia), but there are also many hunted populations for which there is a lack of data and knowledge. We often refer to these systems as data deficient or data poor systems.",

In this approach, the quota in terms of proportion of the population that is removed is constant. For instance, each year 30% of the population is removed through harvest.\nThreshold harvesting: Under this approach, no hunting will be allowed if the population is below a predefined threshold. When the population size is above the threshold, harvest will take place. In the traditional form for threshold harvesting, the population will be harvested down to the threshold. In proportional threshold harvest\n\n\n\n5.1.5 Harvesting age- and stage structured populations\nDescribe how populations of (mainly) long-lived species will be dependent on the age- and sex composition of the harvest off take. Use simulations to showcase + perhaps some real data from moose or red deer in Norway.\n\n\n5.1.6 Harvest management is more than ecology\nDiscuss various studies of hunter efficiency under different conditions, and introduce the concept of Harvest Management Strategy Evaluation (MSE).",
