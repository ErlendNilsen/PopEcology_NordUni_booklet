The course is part of the bachelor education in Nature Management, and the students are (mostly) taking the course in their third study semester.\nBy reading this booklet, you should get a good overview of the topic population ecology. As a next step there are many more specialized books that you can use to dig further into the topic. In general, it will cover the following topics:\nThe book is currently under construction, and many chapters are still only empty skeletons. For the time being, the book is not intended to replace the text book used in the course - but rather serve as a supplement. There is, however, one main part that is not well covered in the text book and for which this digital compendium will be the main source. This is part “Applied Population Ecology”. These chapters will cover some main application of concepts and theory from the science of population ecology, including harvest of wild vertebrate populations, and the construction of population viability analysis by the use of mathematical simulations. In addition, there is a short chapter about the methodology behind the IUCN red listing process, which relies on population ecology theory.",

    "text": "5.1 Harvesting wild vertebrate populations\nOne classical application of population ecology theory is related to harvesting of wild vertebrate populations, including those that live in the oceans (i.e. fisheries!). In this chapter, the focus will be on harvesting of terrestrial vertebrate - including both various species of game birds as welll as mammals of various size and taxa. In the chapter, I will show how the theory surrounding harvest management have matured over the years, and now consists of mature and well-developed body of literature. Importantly, much of the development has happened in parallel in terrestrial ecology and in the fisheries. Marine fisheries are often associated with substantial economic interests, and thus for at least some marine fisheries substantial resources have been allocated to produce better models (and data) to support the quota setting process. The same situation applies to some terrestrial harvest management systems (e.g. moose management in Scandinavia), but there are also many hunted populations for which there is a lack of data and knowledge. We often refer to these systems as data deficient or data poor systems.",

In this approach, the quota in terms of proportion of the population that is removed is constant. For instance, each year 30% of the population is removed through harvest.\nThreshold harvesting: Under this approach, no hunting will be allowed if the population is below a predefined threshold. When the population size is above the threshold, harvest will take place. In the traditional form for threshold harvesting, the population will be harvested down to the threshold. In proportional threshold harvest\n\n\n12.4.1 Harvesting age- and stage structured populations\nDescribe how populations of (mainly) long-lived species will be dependent on the age- and sex composition of the harvest off take.
